## The polar night shift: Seasonal dynamics and drivers of Arctic Ocean microbiomes revealed by autonomous sampling

This repo describes the amplicon-seq workflow published by Wietz et al. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-021-00074-4). Microbial samples were derived from autonomous Remote Access Samplers between July 2016 to July 2017 in different locations of the Fram Strait (Arctic Ocean). Here, we study biodiversity patterns of bacteria, archaea and microbial eukaryotes in ice-covered and ice-free regions, providing a high-resolution portrait of marine microbial ecology over polar day and night. The project is part of the long-term ecological observatory FRAM of the Alfred Wegener Institute (https://www.awi.de/en/expedition/observatories/ocean-fram.html).
