# "The Polar Night Shift: Annual Dynamics and Drivers of Microbial Community Structure in the Arctic Ocean"

This repo describes the workflow for 16S and 18S amplicon data for Wietz et al. (doi: XXX). Microbial samples were derived from autonomous Remote Access Samplers between July 2016 to July 2017 in different locations of the Fram Strait (Arctic Ocean). Here, we study biodiversity patterns of bacteria, archaea (16S) and microbial eukaryotes (18S) in ice-covered and ice-free regions, providing a high-resolution portrait of marine microbial ecology over polar day and night. The project is part of the long-term ecological observatories FRAM and HAUSGARTEN of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (https://www.awi.de/en/expedition/observatories/ocean-fram.html).

Rmarkdowns describing primer clipping (using cutadapt) and ASV classification (using DADA2) 
These result in several output files and sample metadata, including ASV tabels, 
A number of Rscripts document all subsequent analyses and figures
